## This will be a presentation
This is a Shiny app that has been created as a part of the peer-assessed Course Project for the Developing Data Products course on Coursera.  
The app is deployed at [shinyapps.io](https://riglerandras.shinyapps.io/DataproductsCourseProject).  
Source code and other related material is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/riglerandras/DevelopingDataProducts.git).  
As a part of the course project a presentation describing the application has also been created using `slidify` and is hosted on [RPubs]() and also available on [GitHub](http://riglerandras.github.io/DevelopingDataProducts/mtcarsPrediction/index.html).
